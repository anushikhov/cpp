# Introduction to if statements

An **if statement** allows us to execute one (or more) lines of code only if some condition is true.

A **condition** (also called a **conditional expression**) is an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value.

### If-else

If the condition evaluates to Boolean true, true_statement executes. Otherwise false_statement executes.

### Chaining if statements

Sometimes we want to check if several things are true or false in sequence. We can do so by chaining an if statement to a prior if-else. You can chain if statements as many times as you have conditions you want to evaluate.

### Non-Boolean conditionals

If the condition is an expression that does not evaluate to a Boolean value, it is converted to a Boolean value: non-zero values get converted to Boolean true, and zero-values get converted to Boolean false.
