# Statements and the structure of a program

A computer program is a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do. 

A **statement** is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action.

Statements are the smallest independent unit of computation in the C++ language. In that regard, they act much like sentences do in natural language.

Most (but not all) statements in C++ end in a semicolon.

In a high level language such as C++, a single statement may compile into many machine language instructions.

The different kinds of statements in C++ include:
1. Declaration statements
1. Jump statements
1. Expression statements
1. Compound statements
1. Selection statements (conditionals)
1. Iteration statements (loops)
1. Try blocks

Statements are typically grouped into units called functions. A **function** is a collection of statements that executes sequentially.

Every C++ program must have a special function named **main**. When the program is run, the statements inside of _main_ are executed in sequential order.

Functions are typically written to do a specific job.

The rules that govern how sentences are constructed in a language is called **syntax**. 

C++ has a syntax too: rules about how your programs must be constructed in order to be considered valid. If you violate a rule, the compiler will complain when you try to compile your program, and issue you a **syntax error**.
