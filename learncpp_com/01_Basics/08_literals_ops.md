# Introduction to literals and operators

A **literal** (also known as a **literal constant**) is a fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code.

Literals and variables both have a value and a type. However, the value of a literal is fixed and cannot be changed, whereas the value of a variable can be changed through initialization or assignment.

An operation is a mathematical calculation involving zero or more input values (called **operands**) that produces a new value (called an output value). The specific operation to be performed is denoted by a construct (typically a symbol or pair of symbols) callen an **operator**.

Some operators use more than one symbol, such as the equality operator (==), which allows us to compare two values to see if they are equal. There are also a number of operators that are words (e.g. new, delete, and throw).

The number of operands that an operator takes as input is called the operator's **arity**. 

Operators in C++ come in three different arities: unary, binary and ternary.

Some operators have more than one meaning depending on how they are used e.g. the _operator_-.

Arithmetic operators execute in the same order as they do in standard mathematics: Parenthesis first, then Exponents, then Multiplication & Division, then Addition & Subtraction. This ordering is sometimes abbreviated _PEMDAS_.
