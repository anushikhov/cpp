# Common semantic errors in C++

Semantic errors occur when you write code that does not do what you intended. Semantic errors can cause most of the same symptoms of undefined behavior, such as causing the program to produce the wrong results, causing erratic behavior, corrupting program data, causing the program to crash -- or they may not have any impact at all.

### Conditional logic errors 

A **conditional logic error** occurs when the programmer incorrectly codes the logic of a conditional statement or loop condition.

### Infinite loops

### Off-by-one errors

An **off-by-one** error occurs when a loop executes one too many or one too few times.

### Incorrect operator precedence

### Precision issues with floating point types

The more arithmetic you do with a floating point number, the more it will accumulate small rounding errors.

### Integer division

### Accidental null statements

### Not using a compound statement when one is required
