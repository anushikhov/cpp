# Developing first programs

**Best practice**
_When writing a program, try to add one piece at a time, make sure it compiles, and test it. Then when you're sure it's working, move on to the next piece._

The first and primary goal of programming is to make your program work. A program that doesn't work isn't useful regardless how well it's written.
 
_You have to write a program once to know how you should have written it the first time._

The best solution often isn't obvious, and first solutions to problems are usually not as good as they could be.

When we're focused on figuring out how to make our program work, it doesn't make a lot of sense to invest a lot of time into code we don't even know if we'll keep. So we take shortcuts. We skip things like error handling and comments. We sprinkel debugging code throughout our solution to help us diagnose issues and find errors. We learn as we go -- things we thought might work don't work after all, and we have to backtrack and try another approach.

The end result is that our initial solutons often aren't well structured, robust (error-proof), readable, or consize. So unless it is a one-off/throwaway, once your program is working your job really isn't done. The next step is to clean up your code. This involves:
* removing (or commenting out) temporary/debugging code
* adding comments
* handling error cases
* formatting your code
* ensuring best practices are followed

Even the, your program may not be as simple as it could be -- perhaps there is redundant logic that can be consolidated, or multiple statements that can be combined, or variables that aren't needed, or a thousand other little things that could be simplified. 

Too often new programmers focus on optimizing for performance when they should be optimizing for maintainability.

Don't be frustrated if/when your solutions don't come out wonderfully optimized right out of your brain. That's normal.

**Perfection in programming is an iterative process (one requiring repeated passes).**

C++ is one part using what you know, and two parts looking up how to do the rest. Focus less on memorizing specifics, and more on understanding what's possible.
