# Control flow introduction

When a program is run, the CPU begins execution at the top of main(), executes some number of statements (in sequential order by default), and then the program terminates at the end of main(). The specific sequence of statements that the CPU executes is called the program's **execution path** (or **path**).

**Straight-line programs** take the same path (execute the same statements in the same order) every time they are run.

C++ provides a number of different **control flow statements** that allow the programmer to change the normal path of execution through the program.

When a control flow statement causes point of execution to change to a non-sequential statement, this is called **branching**.
