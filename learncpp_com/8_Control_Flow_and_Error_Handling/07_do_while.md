# do while statements

A **do while** is a looping construct that works just like a while loop, except the statement always executes at least once. After the statement has been executed, the do-while loop checks the condition. Of the condition evaluates to true, the path of execution jumps back to the top of the do-while loop and executes it again.

` do `  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;` statement `  
` while (condition); `  

**Best practice**<br/>
_Favor while loops over do-while when given an equal choice._
