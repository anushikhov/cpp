# if statements and blocks

A **conditional statement** specifies whether some associated statement(s) should be executed or not.

C++ supports two basic kind of conditionals: if statements and switch statements.

**Best practice**
_Consider putting single statements associated with an if or else in blocks._

A middle-ground alternative is to put single-lines on the same line as the if or else:

` if (age >= 21) purchaseBeer(); `  

If the programmer does not declare a block in the statement portion of a if statement or else statement, the compiler will implicitly declare one.
