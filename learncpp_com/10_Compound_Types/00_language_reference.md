# Using a language reference

![C++ Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

The upper half of the table shows features currently in the language, while the bottom half shows technical specifications, which are features that may or may not be added to C++ in a future version, or have already been partially accepted into the language. This can be useful if you want to see what new capabilities are coming soon.

Starting with C++11, cppreference marks all features with the language standard version they've been added in. The standard version is the little green number next to some of the links. Features without a version number have been available since C++98/03. Version numbers let you know what you can or cannot use in a specific C++ version.

The C++ versions are C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20. C++23 is the informal name for the next planned iteration.

cppreference is not an official documentation source -- rather, it is a wiki. With wikis, anyone can add and modify content -- the content is sourced from the community. Although this means that it's easy for someone to add wrong information, that misinformation is typically quickly caught and removed, making cppreference a reliable source.

The only official source for C++ is ![the standard](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard) (free drafts on ![GitHub](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/tree/main/papers).
