# C++

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979.

C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee (i.e. ISO committee ratified a document describing the C++ language, to help ensure all compilers adhered to the same set of standards).

A minor update was released in 2003 (called C++03).

Three major updates ot the C++ language (C++11, C++14, C++17) have been made since then. 

Future upgrades to the language are expected every three years.

Each new formal release of the language is called a language standard (or language specification). Standards are named after the year they are released in.

# C and C++'s philosophy

The underlying design philosophy of C and C++ can be summed up as "*trust the programmer*" -- which is both wonderful and dangerous. Knowing what you shouldn't do in C/C++ is almost as important as knowing what you should do.
